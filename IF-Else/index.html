     <h3><b>If/Elses and Relational Operators:</b></h3>

  <p>  Sometimes when writing code, you will have to make decisions based
     on data. This is called “control-flow”, because it controls where your
      program will go next. </p>

<p> The most common way to make decision is using if-statements. If-statements
   allow the programmer to ask if something is true or false, and then do
   something based on that result. Its used exactly how we use “ifs” in real
    life. For example, a parent may say to their child, “If you pass the exam,
    you can play video games”. Here, whether the child gets to play video games
    depends entirely on whether he/she passes the exam.</p>

<p> We can combine this concept with the concept of relational operators.
   Relational operators allow you to compare a variable or value to another
   variable or value. They use symbols you may recognize from elementary
   math class. </p>
<br/>
< : less than<br/>
> : greater than<br/>
<= : less than or equal to<br/>
>= : greater than or equal to<br/>
== : equal to<br/>
!= : not equal to<br/>
<br/>

<p>The ‘==’ operator should not be confused with the ‘=’ operator.
  The ‘==’ operator simple checks if two things are equal in value,
  while ‘=’ assigns the right side to the left side.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some code now:</p>


     <hr>
     <br/>
       <center><img src="image1.jpeg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:550px;height:400px;">
  </center>
     <br/><br/>
     <hr>


     <p>
       Here we are using the equality operator (==) to check if the variable
        ‘num’ is equal to 5, 10 or 15, using an if-statement to check for
        each. The program will run the if-statements in order, checking first
        if it’s 5, then 10, then 15. When it finds a particular condition that
        happens to be true (in this case, its num == 10), it will print out the
        corresponding statement. The first and third if-conditions were
        evaluated as false, and thus the print statements underneath them
        did not run. If the value of num were something other than 5, 10,
        or 15, nothing would have been printed out.



     <br/><br/>
    If you wanted to check if variable is NOT equal to a certain value,
    you would used the != operator in the same way.

     </p>

       </center>
     <br/><br/>
     <hr>




     <p>
       Here you can see the <= and > operators in actions.
       The second if-condition holds true, and thus its corresponding
        print statement is executed.
         <br/><br/>

Sometimes if a condition is true, you want to do something,
 but if its not true, you want to do something else. In this
 case you can use an if-else statement.


         </p>

    <p>
      Since the boolean variable ‘eggs-in-stock’ is set to false,
       the if-condition is evaluated as false, and the print under
        the else-clause will run. If the boolean variable was set to true,
         the print statement under the if-clause would run. Either way,
         you’re coming home with either eggs or milk, but not both.
<br/><br/>
      You can chain several of these conditions together to make if-else-if chains.

    </p>

    </center>
    <br/><br/>
<hr>

<p>
The code will start at the top of the chain, checking each condition.
 Since the first if-clause is followed by else-if clauses, only the condition
 that hold true first will be executed. Thus, even though 72 is greater than
 60, the student will not get a D, because the condition above that holds true
 first, giving the student a C. The else at the end is if none of the above
 conditions hold true. </p>
</br>
<strong>“And’s” and “Or’s”:</strong>
<br/><br/>

<p>
Sometimes you’ll need to check if two conditions hold at the same time.
 And other times you may need to check if at least one of multiple conditions
 holds true. You can use the ‘and’ and ‘or’ operators to do that.
<br/><br/>
&& : and<br/>
|| : or<br/>
</p>

    <center><img src="image5.jpeg"  alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:600px;height:300px;">
    </center>
    <br/><br/>
<hr>

<p>
The if-condition is checking for two things simultaneously:<br/><br/>
  (1)  Is num greater than or equal to 40?<br/>
  (2)  Is num less than or equal to 50?<br/><br/>
Note that both conditions have to be true for the if-condition to b evaluated
as true. Essentially we are asking, “Is num between 40 and 50?”. The answer
 in this case is yes, and so the print statement indicates that. </p>

     </center>
     <br/><br/>
 <hr>

<p>
  Since the value of ‘city’ is “Tokyo”, the else-if clause is evaluated as true.
   Remember that only one part of an ‘or’ operator needs to be true in order
   for the whole condition to become true. So even though ‘city’ is not “Nara”,
   it makes no difference because the ‘city’ being “Tokyo” is enough to make the
    whole clause true.
